## What is Neocities?

Neocities is a free platform for hosting static websites,
 inspired by Geocities, which was closed in 2009.
Neocities hosts more than 1.2 million websites, and mine is one of them

## About my website

I didn't use any CSS or JS frameworks yet, but I plan on using 
Element, Tailwind or Bootstrap for CSS.

## TODO:
- [ ] Finish the main page
- [ ] Stylize it like [LilithDev](https://lilithdev.neocities.org "LilithDev")
- [ ] Add some cool gifs and make a custom pixelart button
- [ ] Rewrite CSS using one of the frameworks mentioned above
- [ ] Add something like a blog, with posts loading from my VPS
- [ ] Add a live chat for visitors
